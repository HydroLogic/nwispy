Welcome to nwispy's documentation!
================================

**nwispy** is a project that contains a python module that reads, processes, plots, 
and allows query capability for USGS NWIS data files. The NWIS data file can be either 
a daily or instantaneous data file. The data file can contain any number of parameters; 
i.e. discharge, gage height, temperature, sediement concentration, etc. **nwispy** also 
contains a gui that allows users to interact and query a timeseries of a particular hydrologic 
parameter from a USGS NWIS.

This software is provisional.  The intended use of the software is to analyze and process USGS 
NWIS data files.
