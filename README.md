**DESCRIPTION**	

	nwispy is a repository for code that reads, processes, plots, and allows query capability 
	for USGS NWIS data files.

	*nwispy.py* is a module that contains functions to read, print, and plot data from an USGS 
	NWIS data file. The NWIS data file can be either a daily or instantaneous data file. The 
	data file can contain any number of parameters; i.e. discharge, gage height, temperature, 
	sediement concentration, etc.
	
	In the *nwispy.py* module, *main()* prompts a user for an NWIS file, processes the file, 
	prints NWIS file information to the console, and plots each parameter found within the 
	data file. Plots are saved to a directory called 'figs' which is created in the same directory 
	as the data file. A log file called 'nwis_error.log' is created if any errors are found in the 
	data file, and is saved in the same directory as the data file. The 'nwis_error.log' file 
	logs errors such as missing data and any erroneous parameter values contained in the file. 
	
	*nwispygui.py* creates an interactive plot of an NWIS data file. User can interact with the plot
	via a SpanSelector mouse widget. A toggle key event handler exists for the matplotlib SpanSelector 
	widget. A keypress of 'A' or 'a' actives the slider and a keypress of 'Q' or 'q' de-activates the 
	slider.
	
	USGS NWIS data files can be found at:

	This software is provisional. The intended use of the software is to analyze and process USGS 
	NWIS data files.
